# CTF-scripts

This repository is made to upload some custom interesting scripts in different programming languages that are useful to solve CTF challenges.

Detailed write-ups are posted on my personal blog: https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf.

For every challenge, there is a `README.md` file that has a link to the write-up.

The aim of this repository is to provide useful scripts that can be adapted to other circumstances and show how some techniques can be performed using a certain programming language.

Hope it is useful! :smile:
